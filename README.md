## **System process flow**

* Consider that an applicant wants to submit his / her profile and CV
* The HR is able to view the list of applicants
* That list should show only the first 10 items
* And that list should be sorted alphabetically
* The HR should be able to select an applicant and view his/her details
* Last, the HR must have option to change the application status (Dropped, Passed)
